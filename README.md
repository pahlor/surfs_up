## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis was to review temperature trends, specifically for the months of June and December, in Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business would be a sustainable year-round business investment. We have data for multiple years on temperature as well as precipitation and can use this dataset to analyze the temperature trends specifically for the two months indicated to deliver the information to our invester. Once we have pulled the temperature data for each of the months we will generate summary statistics for each month.

## **Results**
 * Mean temperatures were comparable and pretty similar, with June mean temperatures slightly warmer
    * June mean temperature: 74.94
    * December mean temperature: 71.04
 * The standard deviation in temperature was slightly lower for June compared to December
    * June standard deviation: 3.26
    * December standard deviation: 3.75
 * Minimum temperatures recorded were lowest in December
    * June minimum temperature: 64
    * December minimum temperature: 56

Both months (June and December) recorded similar maximum temperatures. Mean temperatures were also similar in comparison, however December experienced a slightly lower mean temperature compared to June. December recorded lower minimum temperatures.

To gather more weather data for the months of interest of our investor, an additional query that we can perform include comparing the precipitation for the months of June and December. Another query we can perform can be to look at both temperature as well as precipitation for the months of June and December and filter the dataset to only include data more recent years as compared to all of the years in the dataset (2010 - 2017). Lastly, we can present the results of our analysis visually in a graph to our investor in addition to a summarized report.
